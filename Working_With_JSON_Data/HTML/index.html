    <h2><a href="../HTML/static_json.html">Static JSON Request</a></h2>
    <p>Description: This is a static JSON request of the people in space API (astros.json) stored in JSON folder. The static recreation provides a snapshot of the current individuals present in space. It is retrieved from a predetermined JSON file stored locally, ensuring quick access and reliability. This method is suitable for scenarios where real-time data is not required, and the information remains relatively stable over time.</p>

    <h2><a href="../HTML/dynamic_json.html">Dynamic JSON Request</a></h2>
    <p>Description: This is a dynamic JSON request of the people in space API from <a href="http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json">the people in space API </a>. The dynamic recreation fetches real-time data directly from the people in space API, providing the most up-to-date information about astronauts currently in space. By querying the API dynamically, users can access the latest data instantly, making it suitable for applications where real-time updates are essential, such as mission control centers and educational platforms.</p>
