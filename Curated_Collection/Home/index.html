      <h2>Media/Cultural Interest</h2>
        <p>My media and cultural interests span across various areas, including Mecha, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and History. Mecha has always captivated me with its futuristic giant robots and the thrilling battles they engage in. The genre allows for unique storytelling possibilities and showcases impressive mechanical designs. Sci-Fi stimulates my imagination with its exploration of advanced technology, scientific concepts, and speculative futures.Fantasy, on the other hand, transports me to magical realms filled with human emotion, epic quests, and enchanting adventures. Lastly, I find great fascination in History, as it provides a window into the past, allowing me to learn from the experiences and achievements of old civilization. These interests reflect my enthusiasm for the intersection of future and past, human and machine.</p>
