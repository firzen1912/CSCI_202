        <!-- Brief History and Explanation -->
        <section class="history-section">
            <h2>History Between Vietnam and the USA</h2>
            <p>The historical relationship between Vietnam and the United States is deeply rooted in the tumultuous events of the 20th century, primarily characterized by the Vietnam War, a conflict that profoundly impacted both nations.</p>
            <p>The Vietnam War, spanning from 1955 to 1975, emerged against the backdrop of the Cold War rivalry between communist and anti-communist forces. North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, aimed to reunify the country under communist rule, while South Vietnam, backed by the United States and its allies, sought to resist communist expansion.</p>
            <p>The war inflicted immense suffering and devastation on Vietnam, claiming millions of lives and leaving lasting scars on its land and people. For the United States, the war was a divisive and contentious chapter, stirring widespread anti-war protests and reshaping the nation's foreign policy landscape.</p>
            <p>Despite the end of direct military involvement in 1973 and the fall of Saigon in 1975, the legacies of the Vietnam War continue to reverberate through both countries. However, in the decades since the war, Vietnam and the United States have made significant strides in reconciling their past and forging constructive bilateral relations.</p>
            <p>Today, the relationship between Vietnam and the United States encompasses a wide range of areas, including trade, diplomacy, education, and cultural exchange. Both nations have demonstrated a commitment to overcoming historical grievances and building a future based on mutual respect, cooperation, and shared interests.</p>
